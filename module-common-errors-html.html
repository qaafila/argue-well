            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Even the most seasoned debaters can fall into logical traps. In this module, we'll explore common errors in argumentation, including logical fallacies and cognitive biases. Recognizing these errors will help you strengthen your own arguments and critically evaluate others'.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="logical-fallacies">
            <h2>Logical Fallacies</h2>
            <h3>1. Ad Hominem</h3>
            <p>Attacking the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself.</p>
            <example>
                <strong>Example:</strong> "We can't trust Dr. Smith's research on climate change because he drives a gas-guzzling SUV."
            </example>

            <h3>2. Straw Man</h3>
            <p>Misrepresenting or oversimplifying an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack.</p>
            <example>
                <strong>Example:</strong> "Vegetarians think we should let animals rule the world and humans should starve."
            </example>

            <h3>3. False Dichotomy</h3>
            <p>Presenting only two options when there are actually more possibilities.</p>
            <example>
                <strong>Example:</strong> "Either we cut all social programs, or we'll go bankrupt as a nation."
            </example>
        </section>

        <section id="cognitive-biases">
            <h2>Cognitive Biases</h2>
            <h3>1. Confirmation Bias</h3>
            <p>The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs.</p>
            <example>
                <strong>Example:</strong> Only reading news sources that align with your political views.
            </example>

            <h3>2. Availability Heuristic</h3>
            <p>Overestimating the likelihood of events with greater "availability" in memory.</p>
            <example>
                <strong>Example:</strong> Believing plane crashes are more common than car accidents because they receive more media coverage.
            </example>

            <h3>3. Dunning-Kruger Effect</h3>
            <p>Less competent individuals overestimate their own skills, while more competent individuals tend to underestimate their abilities.</p>
            <example>
                <strong>Example:</strong> A novice who just learned the basics of a subject feeling they are now an expert.
            </example>
        </section>

            <h2>Interactive Exercise</h2>

                    <li>"I've been smoking for 30 years and I'm fine, so smoking can't be that bad for you."</li>
                    <li>"You're just arguing against climate change because you work in the oil industry."</li>
